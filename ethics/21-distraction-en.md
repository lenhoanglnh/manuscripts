#CoolWashing #MuteNews

## Introduction

According to IMDB, the second best movie of 2022 is Top Gun: Maverick.
This movie is the sequel to the first Top Gun installment, which appeared in 1986.
And clearly, these are top quality entertainments.
But should these contents be massively recommended?
What are the social consequences of a massive consumption of this
of this distracting content?

In all, the U.S. Army has clearly asked itself these questions a lot.
After all, according to Wikipedia, and I quote,
"the film was actively supported and influenced by the Department of Defense
and the United States Navy,
in order to portray the U.S. military in a positive light."

In fact, according to Wikipedia,
the main character is inspired by an American military man, Duke Cunningham,
and in particular his prowess in the Vietnam war -
a war where more bombs were dropped on a limited territory
than during the whole second world war!
Moreover, it happens that this same Cunningham became a politician,
and will later admit to having been corrupted,
by accepting a check for 2.4 million dollars...

And so, is Top Gun a recommendable entertainment?
If you think about it, Top Gun actually raises a serious problem,
a problem that could be described as #CoolWashing.
In other words, Top Gun makes cool in the eyes of millions of viewers
institutions, characters, values and habits
that are in fact very problematic for the safety and well-being
of the whole world population.

I am of course speaking mainly about the commitment to the armed forces,
without regard to the nature, legitimacy and appropriateness of the conflicts
of the conflicts in which these armed forces are engaged.
But that is not all.
Top Gun also normalizes elitism, starrification and masculinism,
and even the use of tobacco and alcohol,
especially in the first film.

But if I mention Top Gun in this series on the ethics of information
it is not to criticize this particular film.
The problem of #CoolWashing is much more general.
And, what I will try to convince you of, is that it is even
one of the biggest informational dangers for our civilizations,
often serving as a strategic distraction,
which private companies and governments abuse extensively
so that the information that disturbs them becomes #MuteNews,
i.e. important information that is far too rarely relayed.

In particular, the greatest danger of the spectacularity of AI,
especially applications like chatbots or image generators,
or even promises like health applications,
seems to me to be the #CoolWashing that enthusiasm for these AIs causes.
By attracting talent to the hasty development of these technologies,
this #CoolWashing not only causes a shortage of AI safety,
but it also hinders regulation of these technologies
and attention to their undesirable side effects.

I've heard so many times from researchers, engineers and executives
defend the importance of not slowing down "progress" or "innovation",
because it's all "cool",
without really thinking about the societal consequences of technologies
or even to the risks that they could be reused for undesirable purposes.

3Blue1Brown concluded his video on the exponential progression of COVID in March 2020
with the saying "the only thing to fear is the absence of fear itself." #MesTasDeMetas
I fear that due to strategic distraction and #CoolWashing,
in many cases, like tobacco, climate change or #CoolWashing,
there is far too much reason to fear the absence of fear.
More than #FakeNews, the greatest danger here is #MuteNews.
Unfortunately, the #FakeNews are attracting all the attention and funding today,
for example at the academic or legislative level,
thus making the #MuteNews problem a #MuteNews.


## Big Tech's massive investments

A few weeks ago, I had the honor of being invited to FLAIM,
an academic event organized by Meta at the Institut Henri Poincaré.
For those who haven't followed, Meta is the new name of Facebook.
I spoke about the cybersecurity of machine learning,
and in particular the importance of mathematical theorems
to assess the vulnerability of algorithms developed by learning from user data.

But the theme of the conference was quite different.
It was more about bringing together those who apply machine learning to mathematics.
And it is clear that modern algorithms are capable of spectacular feats,
often very largely superhuman,
especially thanks to the algorithmic formalization of mathematical proofs and their verification.

And very clearly, at this conference, Big Tech was overrepresented,
be it Facebook, Google or OpenAI,
as opposed to academics who generally don't have access
enough supercomputers to perform the monstrous calculations needed to design
necessary to design superhuman algorithms in mathematics.
https://www.ihp.fr/en/events/conference-flaim-formal-languages-ai-and-mathematics

What's more, in addition to the tens of millions of dollars needed
to pay the electricity bill for the supercomputers that do the math,
the cumulative salaries of the researchers present were also certainly in the millions,
or even tens of millions.
So why? Why does Big Tech invest so much in areas that are clearly
are not the most useful for their products, and therefore a priori for their revenues?

Why is Facebook, which is in a difficult financial situation,
invests so much in machine learning for mathematics?
Why did Google buy DeepMind,
and congratulate them for making algorithms
to play chess, go and video games well,
or to solve the protein folding problem?

And why is OpenAI investing so much in producing "artistic" AIs
capable of generating spectacular images
or conversing in a bluffing way?
What justifies, from an economic point of view, the salary of these researchers?

These are the questions I kept asking to the participants of the conference.
And, by and large, no one had even asked the question.
They were all too distracted by the spectacularity of the algorithms developed.
Well, it seems to me that this was the economic objective of the conference.
It was to distract the researchers from the economic and geopolitical stakes of machine learning algorithms
of machine learning algorithms,
and to give the impression that AI is cool,
or even that slowing down its spectacular progress would be immoral.

(while many of their colleagues, notably Frances Haugen and Sophie Zhang,
desperately call for "not turning a blind eye"
on the atrocities to which Meta's algorithms have largely contributed,
such as the Rohingya and Tigray genocides, the information chaos of COVID,
even the Capitol riots and the attempted coup by the extreme right in Germany...)

This is how students of machine learning,
who are very reluctant to work for Philipp Morris or Total,
are happy to apply for and get jobs at Google or Facebook,
or even that members of the Effective Altruism movement swear by DeepMind or OpenAI,
without questioning the civilizational danger
of the algorithms developed and deployed by these private companies.
The #CoolWashing has worked terribly well.


## The strategic distraction industry

There is today a disturbing but widespread confusion
between misinformation and false information.
As if misinformation was only about producing "fake news".
However, the researchers who have chosen to study the producers of disinformation
on the contrary, they notice that the arsenal used by them goes far beyond
the simple production of false information.
To dis-inform, that is to say to remove information, lying is not necessary.  
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52912241

The most striking case is certainly that of Chinese propaganda.
When Stanford researcher Jennifer Pan and her colleagues sought to understand it
they actually discovered, to their surprise,
that this misinformation produced very little false information.
Moreover, the huge troll factories paid by the Chinese authorities
did not in fact often respond to criticism from the authorities.
Instead, these trolls were mostly tasked with "cheerleading",
that is, praising the history of the Communist Party,
and marveling at the symbols associated with it.
With the clear aim of diverting the attention of the Chinese from the dangers of authoritarianism,
mass surveillance and human rights abuses in Xinjiang, Tibet or Hong Kong.

Similarly, as more and more scientists came to the conclusion that sugar is a major source of
that sugar is a major source of obesity, cholesterol and cardiovascular disease
rather than directly contradicting the studies that led to these conclusions,
the sugar industry has invested massively in research on the health risks of... fat!
Instead of denying the dangers of sugar,
they sought to divert the attention of the general public, researchers and regulators.
They relied on strategic distraction.  
https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/well/eat/how-the-sugar-industry-shifted-blame-to-fat.html

In fact, there is even a massive industry that has marketed and standardized
strategic distraction so that the general public doesn't pay attention to these dangers.
Can you guess which one?
Here's a hint: this industry is so huge that it has become the core business
of many of the most powerful technology companies.
It is the advertising industry.
Advertising, more than lying or denying risks,
is nowadays mostly about ignoring risks,
relying in particular on #coolwashing.

And to optimize this #coolwashing,
many dangerous industries have relied on global stars,
like the footballer Maradona who posed for Coca-Cola,
or Beckham, Raul and others who gave their face to Pepsi.  
https://www.vivelapub.fr/footballeurs-et-publicite-le-couple-parfait/

Speaking of soccer, we can mention the case of dictatorships like Qatar,
whose economy relies so much on modern forms of slavery of migrants,
and the case of FIFA, whose leaders have clearly been corrupted by Qatar,
who, following criticism from human rights activists ahead of the World Cup,
called for the distraction of soccer,
rather than pay attention to human suffering.  
https://www.itv.com/news/2022-11-04/fifa-world-cup-countries-should-focus-on-football-not-human-rights-issues

By the way, it is not only FIFA that is being criticized in this regard.
The sport's biggest superstars, whether Mbappé, Messi, Neymar or Cristiano Ronaldo,  
https://twitter.com/totalBarca/status/1610193864425365504/photo/1
are all paid by dirty oil money,
extracted in countries known for their human rights abuses,
and even murders ordered by the dictators in power
(although it is worth noting that Ronaldo is paid more than the other three stars combined!)  
https://tournesol.app/entities/yt:DQOxyTJh-JA  
https://tournesol.app/entities/yt:FkPCec7jG5I

Speaking of human suffering
many influential members of the Effective Altruism movement have clearly abused
the strategic distraction afforded by claiming to want the good of humanity
to commit illegal acts without anyone raising questions.
I am thinking in particular of the con man Sam Bankman-Fried, aka SBF,
whose monumental frauds were clearly facilitated by his #coolwashing
from Effective Altruism.  
https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23500014/effective-altruism-sam-bankman-fried-ftx-crypto

In short. This list is not exhaustive,
and I invite you to propose your own examples of dangerous strategic distraction
in the comments of this video.
I hope I have convinced you that this strategy of disinformation
is at least as alarming as the massive production of false information,
although it is far from the only other strategy.

We can also think of the harassment of critics,
the corruption of decision-makers,
the banning of demonstrations,
censorship of dissenting political opinions
and the manipulation of algorithms by fake accounts, among others.


## Inattention kills

Unfortunately, the information crisis is so often associated with false information,
that the means to solve this crisis,
such as debunking, fact-checking and the Digital Service Act,
are actually very inadequate to combat inattention to important issues.
Worse, by making the #MuteNews problem a #MuteNews,
these measures can actually make the attention problem worse.

It is actually to address this problem of inattention that Sunflower was launched.
In March 2020, in particular,
the alarming inattention to the danger of COVID-19 was well realized.
At that point, much more than the false information,
the problem was that too few people were exposed to information of public interest,
especially about the exponential growth of the pandemic
and the urgency of staying home to avoid a collapse of hospital services.
To be precise, Sunflower was launched a month and a half later, in May 2020,
after my video entitled "the battle for information".  
https://tournesol.app/entities/yt:ecqtrDTfDm4

In the same way, if the tobacco industry has caused monumental devastation
to the tune of 8 million deaths per year according to the WHO,  
https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tobacco  
it is clearly above all by inattention to the dangers that this object represents,
an inattention of which many smokers, but also the civil society and the regulators
are too often victims.

And of course, this inattention is absolutely not accidental.
In particular, here again, the #coolwashing in old movies
will have strongly contributed to the inattention to the dangers of smoking.

In the same way, if the environmental cause abuses more and more
of potentially shocking actions, such as soup on artworks
or protests at major sporting events,
it is primarily to combat the inattention to climate change
of which the general public and politicians are too often victims.
And if #greenwashing is considered so problematic by these groups
it is because it risks above all amplifying inattention to issues that threaten future
that threaten future generations,
and which are already causing human suffering for millions of people
in disadvantaged countries, notably in Pakistan and Madagascar.

I take this opportunity to insist that, very clearly at least in this case
the problem of inattention is not an individual problem.
The inattention of some can be criminal with regard to the safety of others,
especially when it concerns multi-billionaires who profit from oil revenues,
whose massive consumption endangers lives elsewhere in the world.

But I also insist on the fact that the environmental cause
is far from the only one that is sorely lacking in attention.
Around the world, human rights abuses are rampant,
most recently in Russia, China and Iran,
not to mention the catastrophic cases in Ukraine, Libya, Yemen, Myanmar and Ethiopia.
Yet, very often, attention is critical for states to mobilize
and come to the aid of impoverished populations,
like the tremendous support received by the Ukrainian people.
In these cases as in the others mentioned here
inattention is nothing less than a matter of life and death.

I could also point to inattention to mental health issues,
inattention to radicalization and attempted coups,
and inattention to cyber security,
which today terrifies me even more than the risk of nuclear war.

But to finish this list of very dangerous inattentions, in my opinion,
I will talk about the inattention that scares me the most,
namely the inattention to recommendation algorithms.
After all, these algorithms are themselves the engine of inattention.
They are the ones that amplify certain contents,
and which, as a consequence, drastically limit the diffusion of
drastically limit the diffusion of other contents.

By prioritizing distraction,
often strategically designed by disinformation campaigns,
these algorithms kill.
And today, no one cares.
Not least because of the monumental #coolwashing efforts of Google, Meta, OpenAI and others,
which make that, in the eyes of the overwhelming majority of artificial intelligence researchers,
machine learning is so cool that it would be criminal to slow down its progress,
for example with the publication of impossibility theorems,
or via drastic and very restrictive regulations for "innovation".

In particular, nowadays,
it seems to me more problematic to get excited about ChatGPT
without giving major attention to the huge security flaws of this product,
than to write an article about the 10 health benefits of sugar...

## Sunflower's Yellow Rectangle

The inattention to strategic distraction unfortunately leads many to think
that the solution to misinformation lies in moderation.
But very clearly, if we consider that inattention to the environmental crisis
the mental health problem, and the amplification of hate, among others,
is a major aspect of the information crisis,
then "moderating well" is clearly very insufficient.

To really solve the informational crisis, then,
the question that should be asked,
is more about what information the 8 billion humans should be exposed to.
What are the distractions that do not endanger lives?
and what information do we absolutely need to pay attention to?

In particular, if you were the YouTube recommendation algorithm,
what videos would you display on the phones of billions of users,
when they click on the YouTube application?
Or more concretely, what would you want to put in the yellow rectangle
displayed on the YouTube homepage
for all those who use the Sunflower browser extension,
available on Firefox and Chrome?
Should videos about climate change include this rectangle more often?
Or do we need more content about protests in China and Iran?
What about mental health?
Or recommendation algorithms?
What should be in that yellow Sunflower recommendations rectangle?

It is precisely to collaboratively answer these crucial questions
that the Sunflower platform was invented, two and a half years ago.
Now, the platform is fully functional.
And what we need now most to advance
in our fight against the strategic distraction of multinationals and dictatorships,
is for you to help us answer these questions.
And you can all help.

All you have to do is create an account on Sunflower,
connect to your account,
and tell us, between two videos that you have seen,
which one should be in the yellow rectangle more often.

Note that to answer these questions,
it is critical that you compare all kinds of videos,
including videos that talk about very different topics.
In fact, this is exactly how you will help us collaboratively determine
which content is #MuteNews that suffers from inattention
and should be discussed further.

I hope I can count on you,
to help us combat inattention to the major issues of the present and the future,
for which the strategic distractions of disinformation campaigns are so responsible.
